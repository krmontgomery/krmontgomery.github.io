&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in 2018, during my internship and even before it. I couldn't have told you what EDI was. What EDI stood for as an acronym. The need for it or why it's crucial in so many industry sectors. An analogy was shared with me when I was first introduced to EDI. It's similar when ordering something from Amazon. You get updates confirming your order. A notification that your payment went through. To the updates you get while anxiously awaiting for its delivery. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDI—Electronic Data Interchange. Words that might have you glazed over and hovering the "Skip Ad" if it were an advertisement on YouTube. Honestly, I wouldn't fault you either. Behind the dull phrasing of words really is something that impacts all of us. Yet most of us have never heard of it or know what it is.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d have you think about the last time you picked up groceries. Or when you’ve waited for a package to hit your doorstep. What you probably don’t see or even know about, is the digital handshake happening in the background. More often than not, EDI is quietly keeping things moving. Companies like Wal-mart, Kohls, Guitar Center and Tractor Supply use it to track stock, share schedules, and converse back and forth with carriers to line up pickups and deliveries. And all of this happens without anyone picking up a phone or writing anything down on paper.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Transportation, EDI revolves around five primary transaction sets. These transaction sets would be 204, 990, 214, 210 and 997's. When a carrier receives a load from a customer via EDI. It's done so using the 204 (EDI Load Tender) transaction set. The 204 gives pertinent information about the load as well as dates and times of when the load should be picked up and delivered. This goes even further where the purpose of a 204 could be to cancel the original 204 or change information about the original 204. Once a carrier has accepted a load tender, a 990 will then be sent back to the customer letting them know their load offer was accepted. 990's are generally the more benign of the transaction sets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the Amazon analogy. EDI 214’s are the shipment tracking updates. Whether a driver is dispatched, in-transit, at the pickup/dropoff location, a 214 is sent to the customer to communicate that milestone. These updates can be supplemented or entirely replaced by third-party supply chain visibility platforms like FourKites, Macropoint, and Project 44 to name a few. I’ll dig into those in a future post.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDI 210 covers freight billing. Aside from the 214, 210’s are usually more complex. Handling 210’s can involve custom requirements and intensive programming. Due to the challenges of and cost of having an inhouse solution to handling freight bills. Customers may turn to intermediaries like Syncada, Intelligent Audit or Cass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there’s the humble EDI 997, Functional Acknowledgement. It really only has 2 simple purposes. To acknowledge a received EDI transmission. For example, any of the other transmissions specified above. And the other purpose is to let the sender of the transmission being acknowledged know if there were any errors in their transmission. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDI may sound like background noise or corporate chatter, but it’s actually an unsung hero of modern day transportation. It keeps the gears turning quietly, reliably, and comfortably in the background. So next time you walk into a grocery store or your amazon shipment arrives on time, thank the EDI.
